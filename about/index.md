![this is me](/front-end-tech/assets/images/boban.jpg "Boban")
I am a web focused developer mostly working using latest Microsoft .NET technologies. <br />
I am a coffee lover too :) <br />
I am based in Skopje, Macedonia. <br />
This is my personal website and blog where I put down my thoughts, news, solutions to problems and learning notes.

## About this Blog
This site/blog is as result of my passion about front end technologies and 
the desire to try every new technology that comes in and not letting thoughts to fly away, so I decide to share with yo
 Main focus will be posts
related with the very new techs, solutions about
current issues we are facing in industry, tips and tricks...
